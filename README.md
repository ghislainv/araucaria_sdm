# Relict populations of *Araucaria angustifolia* will be fragmented and poorly protected under climate change in southern Brazil

The R script `R/araucaria_2020.R` can be run to reproduce the results of the following study:

**MUNIZ TAGLIARI Mario, Jonatas ALVES, Tiago Cesar Lima SILVEIRA, Ghislain VIEILLEDENT, and Nivaldo PERONI**. 2020. Relict populations of *Araucaria angustifolia* will be fragmented and poorly protected under climate change in southern Brazil

To run the script, you can either execute the `araucaria_2020.sh` shellscript file or run the R script under a R GUI such as RStudio.

## Data
