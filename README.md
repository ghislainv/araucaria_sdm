# Relict populations of *Araucaria angustifolia* will be fragmented and poorly protected under climate change in southern Brazil

The R script `R/araucaria_2020.R` can be run to reproduce the results of the following study:

**MUNIZ TAGLIARI Mario, Jonatas ALVES, Tiago Cesar Lima SILVEIRA, Ghislain VIEILLEDENT, and Nivaldo PERONI**. 2020. Relict populations of *Araucaria angustifolia* will be fragmented and poorly protected under climate change in southern Brazil

To run the script, you can either execute the `araucaria_2020.sh` shellscript file or run the R script under a R GUI such as RStudio.

## Data

Data can be found in the `data` folder. The `araucaria_dataset` folder includes the `.csv` file with raw occurrence data for araucaria species that can be found inside the Mixed Ombrophilous Forest.

## Results

All the results are saved in the `outputs` folder.
